## Study Overview
This dataset supports a scientific investigation examining how  
1. **Screen time patterns**,  
2. **Sleep quality metrics**, and  
3. **Behavioral oral habits**  

jointly influence **caries risk and oral health outcomes** among school-aged children.  
The data include demographic variables, oral hygiene practices, sleep indicators, digital device usage, questionnaire responses, and clinical oral assessments.
